# Unified Telegram Automation Toolkit

This package combines components from the existing projects in this repository.
It introduces a core session manager, a unified configuration model, a Typer
CLI and a plugin system reusing `tgcf` plugins.

Currently only the base architecture is in place. Future iterations will port
member adding and reaction functionality from the other tools.

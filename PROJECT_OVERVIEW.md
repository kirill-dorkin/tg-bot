# Repository Overview

This repository contains three unrelated Telegram automation projects. The READMEs are not completely reliable, so the functionality was inspected directly from the source code.

## Telegram-Members-Adder-main
This project is a mass automation script built with `telethon`. Key capabilities observed in `add.py` and `manager.py` include:

- Manage multiple Telegram accounts from `vars.txt` and store sessions in `sessions/`.
- Add members to a target group or channel by scraping members from another group.
- Send direct messages using all configured accounts.
- Join or leave groups/channels with multiple accounts.
- Report groups/channels and add users found in messages.
- The manager tool allows adding new accounts, filtering banned ones, deleting sessions and updating the script.

It is largely a tool for bulk actions across many Telegram accounts.

## telegram-reaction-bot-main
This project uses the `pyrogram` library to react to posts in specified channels.
Main points from `reactionbot.py`:

- Loads session files from `sessions/` using configuration files (`.ini` or `.json`).
- Converts Telegram Desktop `tdata` folders to Pyrogram sessions if needed (see `converters/`).
- Each session joins configured channels and listens for new messages.
- When a message arrives, all sessions send a random emoji reaction to the post.
- Maintains logs and moves banned or invalid sessions to separate folders.

The bot effectively automates reactions from many accounts.

## tgcf-main
This project is a more complete forwarding framework. Notable features from modules such as `live.py`, `past.py` and `cli.py`:

- Configurable via environment variables, local files or MongoDB.
- Supports *live* mode (forward new messages as they arrive) and *past* mode (forward existing history).
- Uses `telethon` for client connections.
- Allows plugin modules to modify messages before forwarding.
- CLI interface (`tgcf`) and optional web UI.
- Handles message edits and deletions, with options for synchronization.

It is a robust base for custom Telegram message forwarding with extensible plugins.

## Possible Professional Integration
Combining these projects could yield a comprehensive Telegram automation toolkit. For instance:

1. **Unified session handling** – standardize account/session management so all components share the same credentials format.
2. **Modular command interface** – create a single CLI or bot command set that exposes member adding, reacting and forwarding features.
3. **Shared plugins** – leverage the plugin architecture from `tgcf` to allow custom processing for messages or automated actions before they are executed by the add or reaction modules.
4. **Centralized configuration** – adopt a consistent config file or database for API credentials, target channels, reaction settings, and forwarding rules.
5. **Scalable design** – containerize each module, orchestrate via a scheduler or event system so reactions, forwarding and member management can run concurrently without conflict.

Below is an example follow‑up prompt that can be given to continue development toward such integration.

Please help plan and start integrating the three Telegram projects:
1. Telegram-Members-Adder-main – bulk account actions.
2. telegram-reaction-bot-main – automated reactions via multiple sessions.
3. tgcf-main – message forwarding framework with plugins.

Goals:
- Unify session management and configuration.
- Provide a single interface (CLI or bot) to access features from all three.
- Reuse tgcf's plugin system for extensibility.
- Ensure actions are coordinated when using many accounts.

Begin by outlining a high-level architecture and identify which components from each project should be reused or refactored.
